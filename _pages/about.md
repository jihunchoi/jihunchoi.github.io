I'm Jihun Choi and interested in natural language processing and machine learning.
This blog is mainly about my thoughts and papers I read.

Now I'm working as a research scientist at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony).
I received Ph.D. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr) at [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr), and was a member of the [SNU IDS Lab.](http://ids.snu.ac.kr)
